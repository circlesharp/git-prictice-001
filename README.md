my project
readme using diff.

Let's take it short, I just do the rebase and delete the branch m1 and branch m2. The next step I gonna take in push this master branch to the remote repo.
(
  By the way, there are some tips about vim:
    1. G to the last line;
    2. gg to the first line;
    3. o make a new line and switch to the INSERT mode.
)

this readme.md is from branch test.
the content is about the files which branch test owns.

I am in windows now.
I do sth in it.

I now some one (of course, it's me) do some edit in this file at the same time.

Here is the end of this doc.
NO more modification.
